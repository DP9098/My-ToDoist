## Process to Make This Project

I created the task management application "My ToDoist" using Python Flask, HTML, and CSS.

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - First, I made a folder on my PC and installed a virtual environment for the Python modules.

2. **Creating the Main Application File:**
   - Second, I created a file named `app.py` where I imported Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy and wrote the main code.

3. **Designing the User Interface:**
   - Third, I made a folder named `templates` for the user interface templates using HTML.
   - To design these templates, I created a `static` folder, and within it, a `css` folder where I added a CSS file for styling.

4. **Running the Application:**
   - To run the application, I activated the virtual environment and executed `python app.py` from the command line. This started the Flask development server, allowing me to view the application in my web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
